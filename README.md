# About Me

## My Interests
I'm currently a student studying Physics and Computer Science at UNC. I enjoy working on projects that combine both fields, especially when they involve problem-solving, data analysis, or creative coding.

## Websites I Recommend
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) -  YouTube is where I go for both learning and entertainment. I follow channels that produce entertaining, informative, and thought-provoking content.
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) - Spotify helps me stay focused and unwind. I almost always have this website running in the background while I do other stuff.
